Before the summer of code there is a month for community bonding. I spent much of that reading the code for netjsonconfig and working up a mental model of how things should work.

Obviously I had some opinion on how something should be documented and I opened some pull request, [#67](https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig/pull/67), [#69](https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig/pull/69), [#71](https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig/pull/71).

During this month my work was included in [netjsonconfig v0.5.6](https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig/releases/tag/0.5.6)

Another improvement that didn't make into master was [backend for dummies](https://github.com/EdoPut/netjsonconfig/tree/backend-for-dummies) I didn't invest much time in that and in the end never made a pull request.

During this month I had a lot of time to think about how to represent the AirOS configuration and in the end I settled on a tree like structure that I documented [here](http://netjsonconfig.openwisp.org/en/airos/backends/intermediate.html).

Othere than that I began my daily ritual of lurking the IRC channel for user support and writing a report to the mailing list every Friday
