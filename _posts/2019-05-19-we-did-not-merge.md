title: It is fine if your work is not merged

Hello there, I'm assuming you are either a GSOC student who found this blog
or somebody looking for info about integrating NetJSON and OpenWISP. Don't worry
I have good news for both of you.

If you are a GSOC student and you are worried about your work not being
able to be merged in the project I'm telling you, don't worry too much.
There is time after GSOC and the train is not leaving the station yet. You made
good friends, you did a lot of work, if you continue showing up there is always
another merge window.

Actually  it's also good if you don't merge. That's what happened with me at least
and everybody was still happy, and I was too.

You see after the GSOC was done I had an intuition that I could not just dump
thousands of lines of code on somebody's lap and call it a day, after all I was
the most prominent authority on the intersection of NetJSON and AirOS (I had to become) who can
debug the thing I wrote if he's not me?

So my work was not merged in netjsonconfig and instead I focused on
adding a nifty feature that would make the [very next best thing happen. [I added
a plugin awareness to netjsonconfig and made my work a plugin](https://groups.google.com/g/openwisp/c/Qehtop4YJpA/m/Q2ghvv2QCQAJ).

You see it could not be merged because the bar of quality needed to be high
but this won't stop people now from experimenting with it because they are
not bound to my version of netjsonconfig, they can intall and uninstall
my work without loosing the tools they have.

So if you are still interested in trying out my plugin for AirOS
and see if it can fit your use case I suggest you install both netjsonconfig
and [netjsonconfig-airos](https://github.com/edoput/netjsonconfig-airos).

For those interested in trying out this I suggest you get in contact with
me. I don't have access anymore to AirOS hardware to try and I can provide
guidance on how to test your configuration and how to find/work with bugs
and I am a friendly mantainer that is willing to merge patches from you (yes you!).
